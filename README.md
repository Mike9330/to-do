To run the project please use the following steps

1. Make sure you have node.js and npm installed(version 8.5 or later) on your system
    a) Open Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows 
    b) Check installations with: ('node -v' and 'npm --version')
    c) To install nodejs (it will need to be installed first if you have neither), follow the download instructions here: https://nodejs.org/en/download
    d) To install npm use 'npm install -g npm'
2. Once you have verified that both are installed, navigate to the top directory of the project in your terminal/command prompt (the very first folder of the project)
3. Once there run 'npm install' to install the latest packages into your node_modules
4. Now run the command 'npm start' to start running the server
5. Open your web browswer of choice to http://localhost:4200/ to view the application. Enjoy!
